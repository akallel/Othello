CSC 242 final project

aka Team Daybreak

shitty heuristic - corner > edge > inside > more inside

Our project implements the minimax best-move chooser alongside a heuristic of our own design, shittyHeuristic, to create an AI for the popular tile-flipping game Othello. As Dr. Frankenstein once said, "I've created a monster."
